#Summary
Each ship will have a base set of rooms. These rooms will fulfill a specific ship function and some can depend on others. Having the room accommodated by crew will increase the ability of the room's function. Without power the room will not function. Ship types can have special rooms which play on the strength of that [ship's type](https://github.com/SaulGd/Game/wiki/Ship Type).
